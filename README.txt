My game involves a player character avoinding collisions with enemy objects. All of the enemy objects are small red dots. There will be either one or two player characters depending on the game mode selected. In a single player game, the yellow player character can be moved around the screen by using the 'a' key to move left, the 'd' key to move right, the 'w' key to move up, and the 's' key to move down. To select one player mode, press 'o' on the opening screen. If two player mode is selected, by pressing 't' on the opening screen, the controlls for player1 will be the same. For the blue player2, the arrow keys can be used to move around the screen. Regardless of game mode, the space bar will pause the game at any time. Pressing the space bar while the game is paused will un pause the game. In one player mode, the object of the game is to last as long as possible without colliding with an enemy red dot. In two player mode, the object of the game is to outlive the ohter player. Once a player dies, the game over screen will be displayed, and the game can then be restarted in any game mode. To quit the game simply X out of the game with the x at the top right.

My game can be run on the school of computing machines by typing 'make' and then './my_game'. This will cause a window to pop up dipslaying my game. 

The three options I have chosen to impliment are 2, 3, and 4. Start/Finish screen, In-play UI, and textual items using .ttf fonts.

My start/finish screens are displayed when the game is started and after a player dies. They contain directions about what to do to continue from these screens.

My in play UI is my pause menue. This menue is accesses by pressing the space bar during the game. 

I use Truetype Fonts in the creation of my start, finish, and pause screens. The font I use is called Chrusty Rock and was downloaded from the URL below.

Additional features in my game include enemy characters, the ability to reset and replay the game after losing, the ability to choose between two different game modes (one or two player), and more.
